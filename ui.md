# User Interface
The existing ROBLOX user interface no longer accomodates for gear. 
This document details the overhaul of the user interface, specifically for gear development.

When discussing the user interface, this is not limited to the GUIs (graphical user interface), but also any other form of user input, like:
- tap / touchscreen interactions
- mouse interactions
- keyboard interactions

## Overview
The user interface overhaul provides an enhanced vanilla experience, allowing users to utilize the interface that they are familiar with, but with significantly greater control over their experience.

End users will be able to customize their backpack and keybindings. Non-desktop users will have an improved experience as well, with more cross-platform compatibility and better looking GUIs.

Meanwhile, developers will be also be able to customize user's backpack and interact with keybindings in a different manner. Developers will have an improved experience when developing cross-platform code.
